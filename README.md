# vsmobilepr
Currently Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) has support for Pull Requests on desktop view only. Sometime, we just want to take a sneak peek on a pull request on a mobile device. GitHub has a good support for that, but VSTS is lacking this functionality. This project aims to add this feature to VSTS by creating a react native mobile app that will use the existing VSTS's APIs to show pull requests on mobile devices.

## Prerequisites:
1. Install node/watchman: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#node-watchman

3. Install XCode: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#xcode

## Running the app
After cloning the repo, and inside the project folder run:
1. `npm insall`
2. `react-native run-ios`
